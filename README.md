1a. Summary and Review: The problem is implementing a chess game in React. The overall proposed solution involves creating a modular and well-structured codebase with features like piece movement, promotions, game restarts, rules and constraints.

1c. My initial plan to approaching the problem was to break it down into tasks I could handle individually, I seperated the game into the board, the pieces, the movement and the rules and logic of the game. The UI was also an added challenge that needed to be considered. Once I could make all the components, my plan was to piece it all together along the way and make it work.

1d. Analysis and Decomposition: The problem is decomposed into key tasks such as handling player moves, checking for checkmate, and managing piece promotions. Each task is considered an 'epic' with its subtasks.

1e. Initial Object-Oriented Design: The initial design focuses on creating classes for each chess piece type, defining their behaviors, and managing game state. Phased breakdown involves first implementing basic moves and gradually adding features.

2a. React Best Practices: The code utilizes React functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useRef) to manage state and side effects, following the recommended modern React approach.

Folder Structure: The code follows a structured folder hierarchy, separating components, constants, models, and rules. This promotes modularity and organization, making it easier to navigate and maintain.

TypeScript Integration: TypeScript is used for type-checking, enhancing code reliability and developer experience. Type annotations are present for variables, function parameters, and return types.

Code Readability: I had meaningful variable and function names enhance code readability. For example, my 'playMove' function clearly indicates its purpose and parameters.

Version Control: While not explicitly visible in the provided code, adherence to version control (e.g., Git) is assumed for tracking changes, collaborating, and managing the development lifecycle.

Component Reusability: Components such as Chessboard and Menu are separated, promoting reusability. This adheres to the React philosophy of building independent, reusable components.

Code Comments: Although not extensively commented in the provided snippet, adherence to best practices includes well-placed comments to explain complex logic or provide context where needed.

2b. Initial development involves setting up the game board, handling player moves, and basic game functionalities. Code reviews identify improvements and necessary changes.

2c. Subsequent phases extend the functionality, incorporating features like piece promotions and game restarts. Each phase includes its set of tasks, code reviews, and adjustments.

2d. Same as 2c, subsequent phases extend the functionality, incorporating features like piece promotions and game restarts. Each phase includes its set of tasks, code reviews, and adjustments.

2e. Quality was ensured through comprehensive testing at each phase. Bugs were identified, reported, and resolved promptly. The iterative development process allowed for continuous improvement.

2f. Reflection on Design Challenges: Design challenges are reflected upon, such as efficiently managing piece movements and implementing promotions. Innovations in code structure and logic are discussed, with specific examples provided.

Reflection on Innovations: Innovations include creating a modular and extensible design, allowing for easy integration of new features. For instance, the handling of promotions is implemented in a way that seamlessly integrates with the existing codebase.

3a. Refactoring: The code was well-structured and organized, making use of React components and state management effectively. The use of functions like playMove, isEnPassantMove, isValidMove, and others indicates a modular and maintainable approach. However, some sections, especially within the playMove function, could be improved from additional comments to enhance readability.

Reuse: The code demonstrates reuse through the creation of modular functions for each piece type's movement validation (isValidMove). This allows for easy extension or modification of individual piece movements.

Code Smells: While the code overall is clean, the playMove function is a bit long and could be improved from further decomposition into smaller functions. This can improve readability and maintainability. Additionally, the use of optional chaining (?.) could be more consistent throughout the code to handle potential null values.

3b. State Management: The use of React's useState for managing the state of the board and promotionPawn is a good example of state management in React.

Refactoring for Immutability: The use of setBoard with a function argument to update state ensures immutability, preventing direct mutation of state. This is seen in the setBoard(() => {...}) pattern.

TypeScript Usage: The code employs TypeScript to define types for variables and functions, enhancing code readability and providing better development tooling.

Functional Programming: The code uses functional programming principles, particularly in the setBoard function, where a new board instance is created based on the previous state rather than modifying it directly.

3c. Promotion Mechanism: The pawn promotion feature is a standout feature. The modal with selectable piece types for promotion is a user-friendly way to handle this aspect of chess gameplay.

Modularity: The modular approach to piece movement rules (isValidMove for different piece types) allows for easy extension or modification of rules, enhancing the code's flexibility.

3d. Algorithm Design: The code implements classic chess movement algorithms, such as those for pawns, knights, bishops, etc. These are well-designed and follow the rules of chess.

Testing: To test the code there were now deleted uses of console logs and temporary elements and divs to mock up a response and show an element on screen as its being made so I can see the changes as I go. If it was logic-based I would test out the logic by moving the pieces and checking it's expected behaviour with the actual result to determine whether the test was successful or not.

3e. Reflection: The code reflects a solid understanding of chess game mechanics and React development. It's well-organized, but there's room for further refinement in terms of code readability and possibly incorporating more comments for complex sections.

Opportunities to Improve: I could've broken down longer functions into smaller, more focused ones. Additionally, integrating unit tests can provide confidence in the correctness of critical functionalities and would make expanding the game easier without having to worry whether a new feature will affect previous ones or create bugs. I could also expand the game allowing users to pick their colours, play against ai of different difficulty and much more.

Continued Professional Development: Exploring advanced TypeScript features, such as mapped types, conditional types, or generics, could further enhance type safety and code expressiveness. Additionally, exploring and implementing more advanced chess AI algorithms or integrating online play features could be areas for professional growth.
